I am a software engineer transitioning from C++ development to backend development in Go. The [sleep-track](https://github.com/zDonik1/sleep-track) and [Vamo](https://github.com/zDonik1/v0-vamo-tracker) projects showcases what I already know and have used for backend and frontend development.

I also love terminal applications (TUIs).
